# Introduction  

In this post, I will document my journey of learning computer science, including the resources I use, the timeline of my progress, the challenges and obstacles I face, as well as the accomplishments I achieve along the way. I hope to find joy in this learning process and inspire others through my experiences.

# Yearly Planning and Review   

As of today (04/11), my current learning goals include achieving a strong proficiency in Python, SQL, Java, Markdown, and regular expressions (Regex). Additionally, I plan to gain a foundational understanding of C, C++, data structures and algorithms, computer networking, and web development. I understand that this plan is merely an ideal expectation, and I am open to making adjustments based on my actual learning progress.

## Proficiency   

* Python  
    
* SQL  
    
* Java  
    
* Markdown  
    
* Regular expressions    
    
## Foundational Knowledge   

* C  
    
* C++  
    
* Data structures  
    
* Computer networking 
    
* Web development
