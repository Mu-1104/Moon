* Writing a blog in English can be quite challenging, but I am determined to persevere. I truly believe that it's a worthwhile endeavor, and I am committed to seeing it through.

* I've been raising two cats, a [Chinchilla](https://www.purina.co.uk/find-a-pet/cat-breeds/chinchilla#no-back) named "Pudding" with white-and-grey fur and a [Ragdoll](https://www.purina.co.uk/find-a-pet/cat-breeds/ragdoll#no-back) named "Oreo" with white-and-black fur. Pudding, who is just over one year old, has been with me for almost a year, while Oreo, a three-month-old male, was adopted just three days ago. Unfortunately, Pudding has been unable to accept the newcomer and has been hissing at the new kitten. I've done everything I can to console Pudding, but there haven't been any signs of improvement yet. It's been exhausting for me, but I'm determined to keep trying to make things work between them.

* Words that I've kept repeating: I really wanna make a big fortune! Ok, done today.
